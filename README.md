# Removing-outliers-from-image-with-Kmeans-
this code performs K-means clustering on the colors of the image, dividing it into a specified number of clusters, and visualizes the original image alongside the clustered version, where pixels belonging to different clusters are represented using distinct colors.

Make sure you have Python installed along with necessary libraries like NumPy, scikit-learn, Matplotlib, and scikit-image (skimage).
Copy the provided code snippet into a Python script or a Jupyter Notebook.
Ensure that the required libraries are installed and import them as mentioned in the code.
Run the code.
It will load the specified image, perform K-means clustering on its colors, and display the original image alongside the clustered image.
After executing the code, you'll see a Matplotlib window displaying two images:

Original Image: The first image displayed is the original image.
Clustered Image: The second image is the clustered version of the original image, where different colors represent different clusters obtained by the K-means algorithm.
Remember to replace 'path_to_your_image.jpg' with the path to the image file you want to use for clustering. Additionally, adjust the n_clusters variable if you want a different number of clusters for segmenting the image.
